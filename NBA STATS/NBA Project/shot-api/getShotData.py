    """
    
    Since all of the rows in our DataFrame correspond to made shots, we can use LOC_X and LOC_Y to plot them. 
    From inspection of the data,  the x-coordinates go from -250 to 250 (every 1/10 of a foot) and 
    the y-coordinates go from 0 to 940 (also every 1/10 of a foot). 
    We can use this information to plot the shot locations on an overlay of an NBA court. But first, letâ€™s create a basketball court!
    
    We add 60 to the y-coordinate since all the coordinates in our dataset are relative to the center of the rim, 
    and we know that the rim sits 6 feet inside the baseline:
